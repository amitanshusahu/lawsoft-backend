# as a senior typescript and nodejs backend engineer, write the config loader inside src/config/index.ts that reads process.env, validates required env variables using zod (a ConfigSchema). Export typed config object { port, databaseUrl, jwt secrets, aws keys, razorpay keys, rateLimit settings }.
# Suggested commit: "feat(config): add env validation and typed config"
# Make sure imports use relative paths as per folder structure and export named/default as specified.
